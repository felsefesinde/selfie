# selfie
I realized that many Onject-Oriented Programmers lose a lot of time while creating __init__, get, and set methods. Therefore, this app allows developers to enter their variables, select private/public attributes, and receive the formatted and indented printout of all three methods immediately and easily. 
While using the app, the variables should be seperated by commas like shown: (", ")
You can also check the selfiesr.py file which is a sample run of the codes to train the application.
I hope you enjoy using this app and make things easier in Object-Oriented Programming :)
You can use selfie(args, priv), getinit(get), setinit(setf) functions by adding "from selfie import *" code at the beginning of your script.
